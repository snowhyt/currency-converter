/**
 * Inline dynamic requires in the webpack runtime.
 *
 * The webpack runtime has dynamic requires that would not be bundled by ESBuild:
 *
 *     installChunk(require("./chunks/" + __webpack_require__.u(chunkId)));
 *
 *  This patch unrolls the dynamic require for all the existing chunks:
 *
 *     switch (chunkId) {
 *       case ID1: installChunk(require("./chunks/ID1"); break;
 *       case ID2: installChunk(require("./chunks/ID2"); break;
 *       // ...
 *       case SELF_ID: installedChunks[chunkId] = 1; break;
 *       default: throw new Error(`Unknown chunk ${chunkId}`);
 *     }
